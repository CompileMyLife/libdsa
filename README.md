# Generic Data Structures and Algorithms in C
### NOTICE
This library was inspired by Narasimha Karumanchi's "Data Structures and
Algorithms Made Easy" book. It has the basics of creating data structures and
algorithms in C. My goal is to create a library of DSAs to be generic. Generic
as in it can be used for any data type available in C.
## Data Structures

NOTE: More coming soon!
## Algorithms
NOTE: Coming soon!
## Usage:
Use the main.c files in each folder to see how to use the data structure and/or
algorithm.
## Feedback
I welcome feedback and critisism on my inspired implementations.
